## Jekyll 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a blog-aware, static generator. It changes a website with nice templates and allows to focus on the content. It integrates with GitHub pages.

Websites and blogs use Jekyll in different and creative ways. Check some [examples](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites). They include their source code.
